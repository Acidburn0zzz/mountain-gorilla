# Moutain Gorilla

Trent's stab at a single repo to build SDC.


# Build

What is a (full) build went like this:

- take a source "bits" directory or URL
- download all of that to a "deps" or "bits" or "cache" subdir
- clone (or update) all the source directories
    cache/repos/$repo    # pristine clones, for faster clean recloning
- kick off each of the steps (with appropriate order), publishing
  resultant bits to the same local "bits" dir
- 'make upload' to upload bits to the release bits dir ... including logs
