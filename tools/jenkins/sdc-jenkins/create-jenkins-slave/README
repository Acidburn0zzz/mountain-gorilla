This is intended to be copied to the headnode and run from there. Currently
pretty rough and has several things hardcoded for the jenkins rig in EMY. It
also expects:

 - you have your SSH agent forwarded and the account you're creating this under
   has your key (it tries to SSH to the new instance)
 - you have added your SSH key to Jenkins
   https://jenkins.joyent.us/user/<username>/configure
 - you're trying to create a 1.6.3 slave (13.3.1 slave should work fine too
   just not yet parameterized)
 - if you want to build the platform, you'll also need to add fs_allowed options
   (can be added through VMAPI if new enough). And reboot again if you've added
   them after provision.

To setup a new slave run:

    ./create-slave <name>

which will create the VM with VMAPI, install the packages and files and register
the slave with jenkins. We've been choosing butler names, e.g. from
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_fictional_butlers>.

If you already have a zone setup, you can run:

    setup-jenkins-slave.sh

in it, but this will not automatically add it to Jenkins.

NOTE: you'll need 2 files that are not in the repo:

automation.id_rsa - the ssh *private* key for the automation user
jenkins.creds     - a file with 'user:pass' for the user you want to use talking
                    to jenkins
