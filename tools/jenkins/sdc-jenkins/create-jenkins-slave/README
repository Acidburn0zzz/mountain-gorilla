This is intended to be copied to the headnode and run from there. Currently
pretty rough. It also expects:

 - you have your SSH agent forwarded and the account you're creating this under
   has your key (it tries to SSH to the new instance)
 - you have added your SSH key to Jenkins
   https://jenkins.joyent.us/user/<username>/configure (and you know your login)
 - your SSH public key should also be added to the 'admin' user in the DC so
   that you will be able to SSH into the newly created zone.
 - your Jenkins user should have the 'Slave/Create permission' in Jenkins.
   Permissions can be viewed at https://jenkins.joyent.us/configureSecurity/

To setup a new slave run the following from the headnode in your target DC:

    JENKINS_USER=<username> ./create-slave <name> <server> <dataset>

which will create the VM with VMAPI, install the packages and files and register
the slave with jenkins. We've been choosing butler names, e.g. from
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_fictional_butlers>.

The <server> here is a UUID of a server in this datacenter and the <dataset>
here is an image_uuid of the image to use when creating this slave. Most likely
you'll want one of:

 - fd2cc906-8938-11e3-beab-4359c665ac99 sdc-smartos   1.6.3
 - b4bdc598-8939-11e3-bea4-8341f6861379 sdc-multiarch 13.3.1

And where <username> is the login name you use when logging into Jenkins. The
one onto which you added your SSH keys.

Once you've created your new slave you may need to go to Jenkins and add some
more labels such as the 'oldest_jpc_platform' label if your slave is running on
a CN with an ancient platform.

If you already have a zone setup, you can run:

    setup-jenkins-slave.sh

in it, but this will not automatically add it to Jenkins.

NOTE: you'll need 2 files that are not in the repo:

automation.id_rsa - the ssh *private* key for the automation user
jenkins.creds     - a file with 'user:pass' for the user you want to use talking
                    to jenkins
